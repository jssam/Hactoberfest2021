# Developer: Naman Dave
# Project Name: Binary Bucket Sort (or 2-Radix-sort)
# Why this project: 
Sorting is often a mess especially when we talk about O(NlogN) time complexity algorithms.
Bucket sort is a good choice but it is useful only when the distribution has less variance.

I merged some logics about bucket sort and radix sort and defined a simpler, binary logic based binary bucket sort
or 2 Radix sort that has the same time and space complexity as the merge sort but it is way more simpler to understand.
