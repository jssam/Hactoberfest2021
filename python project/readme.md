Steps to run this code:-

1.Python library 
2.Any code editor of your choice. (I am using VS Code)

-> I recommend to use VS code and install the go extension by Microsoft. This will update the import statement according to the code. If you use a new package, it will import that package on save. If a package is imported and not used, it will remove that package from the import.

It's simple to Directory Tree Generator.py with Python. Just click the Run Python File in Terminal play button in the top-right side of the editor.
The button opens a terminal panel in which your Python interpreter is automatically activated, then runs Directory Tree Generator.py (macOS/Linux) or Directory Tree Generator.py (Windows):

Select one or more lines, then press Shift+Enter or right-click and select Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal. This command is convenient for testing just a part of a file.
