		<b>Synopsis</b><br>
		<p>Born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein had a passion for inquiry that eventually led him to develop the special and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and immigrated to the U.S. in the following decade after being targeted by the Nazis. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century, with his work also having a major impact on the development of atomic energy. With a focus on unified field theory during his later years, Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>

				His journey of life

<p>
				 Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm,Germany in secular Jewish family.<br><br>

				 He earned a bachelor's degree from Swiss Federal Polytechnic in 1900 and a PHD from the University of Zurich in 1905.<br><br>
			     In November 1915 Einstein finally completed the theory of relativity which he considerd to be his masterpiece.<br><br> 
                 He always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them.He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance. <br><br> 
				 As a physicist, Einstein had many discoveries, but he is perhaps best known for his theory of relativity and the equation E=MC^2, which foreshadowed the development of atomic power and the atomic bomb. <br><br>
                 Some of his researches are as follows:<br>
                <i>Special theory of Relativity(1905)</i><br>
                <i>Investigations on theory of Brownian Movement(1926)</i><br>
                <i>My Philosophy(1934)</i><br>
                <i>The evolution of Physics(1938)</i><br>
                <i>Out of My Later Years(1950)</i>
				<br><br> During the 1920’s he lectured in Europe, America and the Far East and  was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the leading scientific academies throughout the world. 
				<br><br>He gained numerous awards in recognition of his work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London in 1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935.
                <br><br>In the late 1940s, Einstein became a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),
				<br><br> Einstein died on April 18, 1955, aged 76 at Princeton, New Jersey.
				<br><br>Einstein's brain is now located at the Princeton University Medical Center.
